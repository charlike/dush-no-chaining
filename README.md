## API

### [noChaining](index.js#L55)
> A plugin that removes support for emitter methods to be chainable. Basically, by default [dush][]'s methods (and most of other eventemitters) are chainable and some user don't like that feature that I need.

* `returns` **{Function}**: A plugin function that can be passed to [dush][], [minibase][] or [base][]  

**Example**

```js
const dush = require('dush')
const noChaining = require('dush-no-chaining')

const app = dush()

// by default they are chainable
app
  .on('foo', () => {})
  .once('bar', () => {})
  .emit('bar', 123)
  .off('foo')
  .emit('bar', 333)
  .emit('foo', 1)

// but when add this plugin
// they are not chainable
const emitter = dush().use(noChaining())

const noop = () => {}
const on = emitter.on('foo', noop)
console.log(on) // => undefined

const off = emitter.off('foo', noop)
console.log(off) // => undefined

const once = emitter.once('bar', noop)
console.log(once) // => undefined

const emit = emitter.emit('bar', 123)
console.log(emit) // => undefined
```

## Contributing
Pull requests and stars are always welcome. For bugs and feature requests, [please create an issue](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/dush-no-chaining/issues/new).  
Please read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for advice on opening issues, pull requests, and coding standards.  
If you need some help and can spent some cash, feel free to [contact me at CodeMentor.io](https://www.codementor.io/tunnckocore?utm_source=github&utm_medium=button&utm_term=tunnckocore&utm_campaign=github) too.

**In short:** If you want to contribute to that project, please follow these things

1. Please DO NOT edit [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [.verb.md](.verb.md) files. See ["Building docs"](#building-docs) section.
2. Ensure anything is okey by installing the dependencies and run the tests. See ["Running tests"](#running-tests) section.
3. Always use `npm run commit` to commit changes instead of `git commit`, because it is interactive and user-friendly. It uses [commitizen][] behind the scenes, which follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.
4. Do NOT bump the version in package.json. For that we use `npm run release`, which is [standard-version][] and follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.

Thanks a lot! :)

## Building docs
Documentation and that readme is generated using [verb-generate-readme][], which is a [verb][] generator, so you need to install both of them and then run `verb` command like that

```
$ npm install verbose/verb#dev verb-generate-readme --global && verb
```

_Please don't edit the README directly. Any changes to the readme must be made in [.verb.md](.verb.md)._

## Running tests
Clone repository and run the following in that cloned directory

```
$ npm install && npm test
```
